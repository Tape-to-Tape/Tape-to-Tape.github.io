So this Jack Eichel guy seems like he might be a good hockey player.

Okay, so that's an understatement. He looks like a really, really good hockey player, and he hasn't yet played ten games in the National Hockey League. In his first game, Eichel scored a power-play goal. Eichel's skating, lauded during his freshman year at Boston University, was on display a few nights ago in Buffalo. Eichel grabbed a loose puck just inside the Columbus blueline, skated along the boards and then tucked a wrist shot just inside the crossbar for an early Goal of the Year candidate. In doing so, Eichel electrified western New York in a way not seen since hydroelectric power was first culled from Niagara Falls.

There is no doubt that Monday's goal against Columbus won't be the last time Eichel lights the lamp in spectacular fashion. As fantastic as Eichel's displays of skill have been early in his Sabres career, what's been even more impressive has been the manner in which the burgeoning star has carried himself since the Sabres selected him second overall in June's NHL Entry Draft. Eichel's introduction to Buffalo came via a promotional tour around the city that felt anything but promotional. Sure, Eichel was brought around to various sponsors, but his enthusiasm never seemed forced. It seemed quite clear that Eichel wanted to be in Buffalo. Even if some in Buffalo felt he was the consolation prize in the McEichel Derby, Eichel never once wavered in his delight in being a Buffalo Sabre. In fact, in a recent “Beyond Blue & Gold” episode featured on the Sabres' website, Eichel responded to a Buffalo executives comment that “maybe (Buffalo) had won the lottery” with a deadpanned “I think you did.” That says something.

Buffalo is a blue-collar city in a blue-collar region, and not in the corny, Don Cherry way. Buffalo loves its' athletes in a different way than many, if not most, other cities. Buffalonians, and really western New Yorkers in general, love athletes that are like them. In a hard-working, honest city, hard-working and humble athletes are often held in the highest esteem. Eichel seems to be the best of all things in that regard. He is an all-world talent with all-universe humility, as hard-working as the blue-collar town north of Boston where he was raised. Eichel's choice to keep his rookie number, 41, during training camp instead of switching to 15, the number he announced he would wear during the regular season, highlights his approach to his rookie season. The young star takes nothing for granted, even with near certainty that he will be a fixture in Buffalo's lineup this season. Eichel's spot on the team is so sure, in fact, that he's already agreed to live with Matt Moulson and his family in a Buffalo suburb this season.

Much has been made recently about the rebirth of the city of Buffalo. In many ways, the rebirth of the city mirrors the rebirth of its beloved hockey club. Young people, many like Jack Eichel, are flocking into Buffalo and the surrounding area. Once the butt of too many jokes to count, Buffalo is now quickly becoming a shining example of what a 21st Century urban renewal looks like. Even though the rebirth is still in its infancy, this is an exciting time in Buffalo.

Just imagine how much more exciting it will be with Jack Eichel leading the Sabres into meaningful April hockey.
