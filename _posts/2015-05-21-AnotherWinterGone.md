“With temperatures reaching into the lower 40s, it looks like the deep freeze we've had is finally over...” 

Those words are like knives to pond hockey players. They signal the end of another winter, and the end of another season on the pond. Ask anyone who has skated outside, and they'll tell you that days spent outside on the pond are some of the warmest memories they have. Friendships (like the one shared by this blog's co-creators) are built and cemented on cold, cloudy days in late December and early January, when ponds begin what many non-pond hockey enthusiasts describe as the long, dark days of winter. Not us, however. 

Pond hockey players are a different breed. You can often find us on warm summer days with a distant look in our eyes, silently counting down the days until the cold settles on lakes and ponds and we can truly be free again. You see, there's something eminently unrestrained about skating on ponds. Nothing is constricted or limited. Players aren't constrained by ice time. No Zamboni honks impatiently. No rink manager has to harangue a player for his (or her) five dollar entry fee. The rules are often simple and practical. You shovel, you play. Keep the puck down. Try not to kill anyone with a slapper. In fact, try to avoid slapshots altogether. The freedom brings out a creativity in kids that leads to a lifelong passion, and brings out in older players a youthful energy that instantly delivers a smile to even the toughest of faces. 

The constant flow of smiles and warming beverages (of both the adult and regular varieties) keep players on the frozen expanse long after most would head for warmer settings. Pond hockey enthusiasts know that winter's cold is far too fleeting to waste indoors. It must be savored and preserved inside memories that sustain our souls through long, hot summers spent longing for the freedom of the pond.
