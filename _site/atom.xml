   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome  to Tape-to-Tape Our aim is to be a different kind of hockey blog.
You won&amp;#39;t find in-depth game recaps here, nor will you find too much game analysis, though we will dedicate some time to analytics.
Our blog will cover the less-talked about aspects of the game, and will focus more on stories and less on analysis. This is not just an NHL-blog.
We&amp;#39;re hockey people. We love all aspects of the game, from days spent on frozen ponds to early morning skate-and-shoots.
Our goal is to share our passion for the game we love with others who live and breathe hockey. We hope you&amp;#39;ll enjoy our blog!&lt;/p&gt;
